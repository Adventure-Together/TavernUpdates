## Tavern Developer Update — July 7, 2025

### Description

This patch adds a new patch notes section, QR code sharing for project pages, TTS map downloads from the Sandbox, and a role request feature for Creator or Vendor access.

### Changes

#### Generating a QR Code for your Tavern Page
- Open the project page (not as the owner/designer), just click on it from the landing page
- Click on the "Share" button
- Choose "Generate QR Code" from the dropdown
- QR Code Should Generate and be available for use as needed

#### Tavern Patch Notes Section
- In the top-right corner of the UI, adjacent to the notifications bell, you will see a new "notepad" icon. This is where ALL Tavern Patch notes will be sent moving forward to ensure everyone is aware of new features being deployed.

#### Download TTS Version of Sandbox Map
- Head to the "Sandbox" page inside of Tavern
- Click on one of your created maps
- Click on "Download TTS Map" on the right-hand side
- Choose your file path ("Documents -> My Games -> Tabletop Simulator -> Saves")
- You can now load the Sandbox Map in TTS

#### Buy Section Settings
- Added customizable Buy section settings in the project. You can now set custom text and a link. If the Buy option is enabled, a Buy button will appear on the project’s landing page.

#### Role Request
- We have added the ability to request roles on the "My Account" UI in the "Role Access" tab. This will be used for new users who sign-up for the system and want the "Creator" or "Vendor" roles. (Creator role is used for Independent Developers & Vendor role is used for Artists, Manufacturers, Writers etc...) When you request a role, the Adventure Together team will receive a notification and approve the request to grant the role.

#### Mailing List
- Added a mailing list popup to project pages, allowing users to subscribe for updates on tabletop games, community events, and developer insights from SOURCE Tavern.

#### Bug Fixes
- Limited draft creation to one per project
- Improved overall performance
- New versions now default to the latest draft version upon creation
